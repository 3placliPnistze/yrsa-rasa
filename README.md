# Yrsa

Type family **Yrsa** is an open-source type family published by [Rosetta](https://rosettatype.com) with a generous incentive from Google. The typeface is going to support some 45+2 languages in Latin and Gujarati scripts in 5 weights and will be freely available from the Google Fonts directory, once it is ready. Design and production are done in-house, by [Anna Giedryś](http://ancymonic.com) (@ancymonic) and [David Březina](http://davi.cz) (@MrBrezina).

What makes Yrsa different is the design approach. It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces to produce a new one. The Latin part of Yrsa is based on [Merriweather](http://sorkintype.com/fonts.html#mw) by Eben Sorkin. The Gujarati is based on David Březina’s [Skolar Gujarati](https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati).

See the [Yrsa project page](http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa) for details. **The project is still in its early stages.**

This repo contains sources for Glyphs, TrueType-flavoured OpenType `.ttf` and PostScript-flavoured OpenType `.otf` font files. The UFO files are a derived source, exported from Glyphs. They are provided as is.

## Rosetta – world typography specialists

Rosetta addresses the needs of global typography. Together with our collaborators we create original fonts for a polyphonic world. Our work has been featured and awarded. But most importantly it has enabled people to read better in their native language.

So far our retail library supports pan-European Latin, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Cyrillic (besides Slavic languages we also support many Asian languages), Inuktitut, and Indic scripts like Gujarati and Devanagari. In total, the library covers more than 200 languages.
