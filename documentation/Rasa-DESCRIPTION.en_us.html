Rasa is an open-source type family published by Rosetta with generous financial support from Google. 
The family currently has 5 weights.

Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles in online news, magazines, blogs), Rasa supports over 92 languages in Latin and 2 in Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi). The fonts supports a wide array of basic and compound syllables used in Gujarati.
A Latin-only version is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Yrsa">Yrsa</a>. 
In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.

The project design and production was done in-house by Anna Giedryś and David Březina.
What makes Yrsa and Rasa project different is the design approach. 
It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces to produce a new one. 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>. 
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.

The Yrsa and Rasa project is led by Rosetta, world-typography specialist and font publisher based in Europe.
