A version is that also supports 2 languages in the Gujarati script, Gujarati and Kachchi, is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rasa">Rasa</a>. 
In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin is adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.

The project design and production was done in-house by Anna Giedryś and David Březina.
What makes Yrsa and Rasa project different is the design approach. 
It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces to produce a new one. 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>. 
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.

The Yrsa and Rasa project is led by Rosetta Type, a type design foundry based in Europe.
