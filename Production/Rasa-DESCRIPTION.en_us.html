Rasa is an open-source type family published by Rosetta with generous financial support from Google. 
The family currently has 5 weights.
</p>
<p>
Rasa supports some 45 languages in Latin and 2 in Gujarati script, Gujarati and Kachchi.
A Latin-only version is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Yrsa">Yrsa</a>. 
In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin is adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.
</p>
The project design and production was done in-house by Anna Giedryś and David Březina.
What makes Yrsa and Rasa project different is the design approach. 
It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces to produce a new one. 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>. 
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.

The Yrsa and Rasa project is led by Rosetta Type, a type design foundry based in Europe.
